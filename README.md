# carl-robot

"Children-Approved Robotics Lab" (The kids named it "Carl", and I had to come up with something)

This repo holds design info for a small robot I built for learning robotics software development.  

The main components include a Raspberry Pi 4, an Arduino Uno (to control the DC motors, and measure battery voltages), and the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2.
